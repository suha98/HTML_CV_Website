					<h1>Tahia Tabassum</h1>
					<p><em>Teaching Assistant at <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a></em></p>
					<p> I am a programmer with an unending love of tea and books. During the moments that I'm not working on a project, or traipsing through a fantasy land, I can usually be found teaching others. I throughly enjoy learning new skills and then passing the knowledge on to someone else; my research interests focus on using Machine Learning, HCI and Data Science, to understand how humans gain their abilities to learn and come up with enjoyable and effective ways to help them better do so. </p>
